# Low-level Requirements

## Minimum Height Rules

- **Over a populous area or public gathering:** 1,000 ft above the highest feature or obstacle within a horizontal radius of 300 m of the point on the ground or water immediately below the helicopter.

- **Other areas:** 500 ft above the highest feature or obstacle within a horizontal radius of 300 m of the point on the ground or water immediately below the helicopter.

These limits do not apply during take-off and landing, conducting a forced or precautionary landing, or to avoid adverse weather conditions.

To fly below these heights you need:

- Helicopter category rating
- Low-level rating, and
- Conduct a risk assessment before the flight

Aerial mustering, sling operations winching and rappelling have further training requirements.
