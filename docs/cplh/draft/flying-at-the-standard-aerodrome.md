# Flying at the Standard Aerodrome

- non-standard procedures are listed in ERSA, almost all aerodromes have non-standard procedures.
- You must take off or land into wind
- Standard left turns for circuits
- Circuit standard height is 1,000 ft

- Within 10 nm of an aerodrome
- At a height above the aerodrome that could result in conflict with operations at the aerodrome

- a further broadcast of your intentions at 3 nm

| Aircraft Performance |    Speed     | Height AGL |
| :------------------: | :----------: | :--------: |
|         High         | above 150 kt |  1,500 ft  |
|        Medium        | 55 - 150 kt  |  1,000 ft  |
|         Low          | below 55 kt  |   500 ft   |

## Departures

- on takeoff, maintain track until at 500 ft agl

- Depart the aerodrome by extending one of the circuit legs, no turns before 3 nm of aerodrime

## Arrivals

- join on midfield or downwind

- join base, crosswind only if HLS is outside the runway and circuit does not cross centrelines

- Overfly the field at 2,000 ft to find runway in use.
- Descend to 1,000 ft circuit height to join the circuit at midfield
-

- turn on to final should be completed at above 500 ft agl

- be established on final 3 nm from aerodrome
