# Pressure

Pressure is the force acting on some area, for example pounds per square inch (psi) of kilograms per square centimeter (kg/cm2).

Mathematically it can be expressed as:

pressure = force / area

Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere at sea level and is accepted universally as being 14.7 psi or 760 mmHg. This is referred to as one atmosphere of pressure.

Barometric pressure varies according to atmospheric conditions - the weather.

Kinetic gas theory explains the behaviour of gasses under conditions of varying pressure and temperature. Pressure is the spped and mass of molecules hitting a surface. temperature increases the speed.

The kinetic energy of any gas at a given temperature is the same as the kinetic energy for the same number of molecules of any other gas at that temperature.
