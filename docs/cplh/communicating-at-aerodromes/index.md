**Broadcast to Avoid Collision**

You must broadcast whenever you think it's necessary to avoid a collision with another aircraft.

**Consider broadcasting when:**

- You're 10 nautical miles away from the aerodrome
- You're joining a circuit
- You've landed and are clear of the runways
- You're starting to taxi
- You're about to enter a runway

**When you broadcast, include the following information, in this order:**

- The name of the aerodrome, followed by the word TRAFFIC.
- Your aircraft's type and callsign.
- Your current altitude (if appropriate).




## Class C & D Aerodromes (Controlled)

You need to get clearance before you:

- Enter controlled airspace
- Taxi on any part of the maneuvering area
- Enter, cross, or backtrack on a runway
- Take off
- Land

When you first contact Ground or Tower without a flight plan, state your intentions. For example, you might say, "ABC with inbound details" or "ABC with outbound details."
