# Civil Aviation Legislation

Legislation is the process of making laws.

## Primary Legislation

Primary legislation refers to laws made by Parliament. Primary legislation is created by drafting, debating and voting on bills. Once passed and assented to by the Governer-General, bills become laws.

The Civil Aviation Act of 1988 (CAA) is the primary legislation that created the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) and empowered it to issue delegated legislation for civil aviation.

## Delegated Legislation

Delegated legislation refers to laws made under the authority granted by primary legislation. Delegated law has the same power as a law made by the Australian Parliament. Parliament can overrule delegated law.

## Legislation Issued by CASA

Laws introduced by CASA include the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 (CAR) and the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 (CASR). CASA is progressively migrating and updating laws from the CAR to the CASR.

The CASR is made up of parts including:

- Administrative Matters

- Flight Operations

- Flight Crew Licensing
