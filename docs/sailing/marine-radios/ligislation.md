# Legislation

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) regulates Australia's radio communications and telecommunications under the Radio Communications Act 1992 and other legislation.

The Radio Communications Act regulates the use of radio frequencies. Very High Frequency (VHF) equipment is licensed under the General Maritime Ship Station class, requiring no individual applications or fees. Each piece of High Frequency (HF) equipment requires an individual station license issued by ACMA.

You must hold the necessary qualifications to operate VHF or HF marine radio equipment:

- To operate a station with **VHF equipment**, you must have a **Short Range Operator Certificate of Proficiency (SROCP)**

- To operate a station with **HF equipment**, you must have a **Long Range Operator Certificate of Proficiency (LROCP)**
