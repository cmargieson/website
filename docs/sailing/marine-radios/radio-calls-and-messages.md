# Radio Calls and Messages

Radio calls are short phrases used to initiate a communication. Radio messages are the content of the message being communicated.

## Routine Calls and Messages

To initiate a radio call:

1. **Determine the correct frequency:** Ensure you are calling the station on a frequency they are actively monitoring. For Very High Frequency (VHF) this will be channel 16 for High Frequency (HF) it will be a distress, urgency or safety channel.

2. **Check for clear frequency:** Before transmitting, listen to ensure the frequency is not in use by others.

3. **Follow the correct format:** Structure your call as follows:

   - **Call the station.** State the name or call sign of the station you are contacting.
   - **Identify yourself.** Provide your own call sign or identification.
   - **State your position.** Indicate your location (e.g. distance and bearing).
   - **Describe your request.** State the nature of your message.
   - **Suggest a working frequency.** Propose a frequency for the actual message exchange.
   - **End with "Over".** This indicates that you expect a response from the station.

Example call:

> "New South Wales Marine Radio, this is sailing boat Illusion inside Sydney Heads with logon details. Suggest channel 73. Over."

You have established communication once the station being called responds. You can now send the content of your message including your identity.

Example message:

> "Illusion, registration alpha bravo charlie one two three november, inside Sydney Heads travelling North to Broken Bay arriving 1500. Three poeple on board. Mobile number: 0412 345 678. Over."

## Distress Calls and Messages

:::warning
Do not transmit false or misleading distress, urgency, or safety messages. This is a serious offense that can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment, under the Radiocommunications Act 1992.
:::

Distress calls may be directed to a specific station or broadcast to all stations. Mayday is the most urgent, followed by Pan-Pan, and then Securite. Mayday has the highest priority and must be given immediate attention, even if other transmissions are in progress.

- **Mayday.** Used when there is an immediate threat to life.
- **Pan-Pan.** Used when there is an urgent situation that does not immediately threaten life or threatens property.
- **Securite.** Used to transmit important navigational or safety information.

Distress calls follow the same format as routine calls, but instead of naming the station, you begin with "Mayday," "Pan-Pan," or "Securite" repeated three times.

Example call:

> "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is sailing boat Illusion, Illusion, Illusion.

No response is expected after making a mayday call, broadcast your message after a brief pause. All other stations must stop transmitting.

Example message:

> Mayday Illision. Three nautical miles East of Barrenjoey. Sinking. Three people on board. EPIRB activated. Over.
