# Radio Equipment

## Transmitter and Receiver

A transmitter generates radio waves by converting electrical signals into electromagnetic radiation. This radiation is then emitted through an antenna. A receiver is a device that captures these radio waves and converts them back into electrical signals. More powerful transmitters can send signals further. Very High Frequency (VHF) radios generally capped at 25 watts.

To reduce background noise, VHF radios feature a squelch control. This automatically mutes the speaker when no radio signal is being received. A comparable function, termed 'mute,' serves the same purpose on High Frequency (HF) radios.

## Antenna

A VHF antenna, typically a short vertical whip or rod, is significantly smaller and simpler in design compared to a larger HF antenna.

An antenna tuning unit (ATU) on an HF radio improves power transfer by matching the impedance of the radio and its antenna. Impedance is the opposition to the flow of energy in the antenna. An antenna's impedance is different at different frequencies.

## Power Supply

**Voltage (V)** is **how strong** the electrical current is. **Ampere-Hours (Ah)** is **how much** electricity the battery can store

- Connecting batteries in **series** increases the **voltage**.
- Connecting batteries in **parallel** increases the **ampere hours**.

Fuses are safety devices that protect electrical circuits from excessive current. If your device draws too much current, the fuse will interrupt the flow of electricity to prevent overheating and fire. You should only replace a fuse with the exact one recommended by the manufacturer.

<summary>Lead Acid Batteries</summary>

The lead-acid battery was the first rechargeable battery. They have been superseded by sealed batteries that do not require maintenence.

Each cell within a lead-acid battery produces 2 volts. A typical 12-volt car battery contains six cells connected in series.

Lead-acid batteries produce hydrogen gas when being charged, which is highly flammable. Charging batteries need proper ventilation to prevent the accumulation of potentially explosive gases.

Lead-acid batteries use sulfuric acid as their electrolyte. The specific gravity of the electrolyte reflects the battery's charge. A hydrometer is used to measure specific gravity. A fully charged lead-acid battery has a specific gravity of 1.250. You can replace eveporated electrolyte with distilled water - using sea water will cause the battery to self-discharge.
