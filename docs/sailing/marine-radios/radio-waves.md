# Radio Waves

A hertz (Hz) is a unit of frequency that measures how often something happens per second. For example, if something vibrates 10 times per second, it has a frequency of 10 hertz.

The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.

The electromagnetic spectrum is organized by frequency, radio waves have lowest frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum. The radio spectrum includes frequencies from 3 Hz to 3,000,000,000,000 Hz (3,000 GHz).

The radio spectrum is allocated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for different radio technologies. Marine radio is allocated to frequencies in the Very High Frequency (VHF) and High Frequency (HF) spectrum.

| Name               | Abbreviation | Frequency       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| Very High Freqency | VHF          | 30 - 300 MHz    |
| High Frequency     | HF           | 3 - 30 MHz      |
| Medium Frequency   | MF           | 300 - 3,000 kHz |

- **VHF** signals travel as **ground waves** in a straight line and can only reach as far as the line of sight between antennas. VHF has a range of about **3 nm**.
- **HF** signals travel as **sky waves** bouncing off the ionosphere increasing their range to **100 - 400 nm**.
