# Enriched Air Diving

<!-- truncate -->

Under water, pressure is exerted from the weight of the water and the weight of the atmosphere. 


Composition of air (%):

Nitrogen 78.084
Oxygen 20.946
Argon 0.934
Carbon Dioxide 0.033

The remaining components are rare gasses accounting for 0.003

neon, helium, krypton, hydrogen, xenon, radon and carbon monoxide.

Helium is used as a substitute for nitrogen by deep commercial and military divers because it does not produce narcotic effects under pressure.
