<!-- truncate -->

## Central Coast

### Ourimbah State Forest

**Topo Map:** [Wyong 9131-2N](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/9131-2N+WYONG.pdf)

Follow the well-maintained Red Hill Road between Kulnura and Wyong. The busy [Central Coast Mountain Bike Club](https://www.ccmtb.com.au/) trails are at the Wyong end. Middle Ridge Road South to Palmdale is closed to prevent illegal dumping. Many fun diversions, mostly leading nowhere. 

### Watagans National Park

**Topo Map:** [Wyong 9131-2N](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/9131-2N+WYONG.pdf) [Dooralong 9131-1S](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/9131-1S+DOORALONG.pdf) [Morisset 9131-1N](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/9131-1N+MORISSET.pdf) [Quorrobolong 9132-2S](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/9132-2S+QUORROBOLONG.pdf)

Watagan Forest Road starts at Wyong State Forest near Jilliby and tracks North through the Jilliby State Conservation Area and Olney State Forest before entering Watagans National Park. Watagan Forest Road is closed at the North near Quorrobolong due to a landslip. Exit via Heaton Road to Awaba near the [Awaba Mountain Bike Trails](https://hmba.asn.au/riding-with-hmba/awaba-mountain-bike-park/).

## Lithgow

### Lisdale State Forest

**Topo Map:** [Lithgow 8931-3S](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/8931-3S+LITHGOW.pdf)

<CloudinaryImage publicId="90c723f2-669a-4799-8423-add7a31bec5d_kcnnts" />

Heading East from Rydal Cemetery leads to a steep, well-graded descent followed by a very steep, awkward climb. Cemetery Road leads North through the [Central Tablelands Mountain Bike Club](https://ctmbc.wordpress.com/)'s trails then easy riding along the railway, park boundary or through the plantation.

### Marrangaroo National Park

**Topo Map:** [Lithgow 8931-3S](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/8931-3S+LITHGOW.pdf)

Enter Sugarmans Road from the Great Western Highway at the North of the Park. Track South crossing the Coxs River. Mount Walker is closed to traffic for development of the [Lake Lyell Pumped Hydro Project](https://www.lakelyellpumpedhydro.com.au/), but is accessible by foot. Continuing to the east leads to a locked gate where Mount Walker road leaves the national Park onto private property. Mount Walker Road becomes extreme further South to the point at Lake Lyell. Station Road is impassable at the Coxs River crossing. Exit back via Sugarmans Road.

### Rydal 4WD Area

**Topo Map:** [Lithgow 8931-3S](https://portal.spatial.nsw.gov.au/download/NSWTopographicMaps/DTDB_GeoReferenced_Raster_CollarOn_161070/2022/25k/8931-3S+LITHGOW.pdf)

Rydal 4WD Area is found at the Eastern end of Bloody Cutting Road South of Rydal. Many steep, rocky sections most with alternative escapes back to Bloody Cutting Road. Unavoidable steep climbs to the North to enter Lisdale Satate Forest.
